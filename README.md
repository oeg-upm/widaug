# Widaug

Widaug is a data augmentation system for named entity recognition (NER) using Wikdiata.

The library is currently under construction to provide more facilities and uses to the final user.

Examples of use are presented in examples folder

## Install

python setup.py install 


## Experiments
The core of the experiment performed for the SEPLN paper is provided in the folder experiments/sepln2022 



## Disclaimer
Currently, the repo is being refactorized and improved to present a strong library further than a simple experiment.

Please consider to contact me if there is any problem. I am cleaning code as fast as possible.
